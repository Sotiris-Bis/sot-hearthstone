    <h1>Welcome to my hearthstone app</h1>
    <h2>This app exist to provide players with correct information about the available cards you can pick in the arena draft.</h2>
    <p>
      In the Arena page is a table with all the cards you can pick with varius filters to apply
    </p>
    <p>
      The all cards page provides a table with all Hearthstone cards and lots of filter to help you find the card you are looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cards per hero page gives you a full image list of the cards
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally there is a 12 win arena page, where i post the decks that made it. Some of them containing 3 or more copies of the same card
      so i am unable to provide you with a deck code.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will find some weird stuff in the card data like neutral spells. Sorry folks, This is what Blizzards' Database says
